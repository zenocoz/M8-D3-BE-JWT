BackEnd
Add token based auth to your previous backend. Create in your database a "user" collection with username and password, using the right tool to hash passwords.

Create a service test with two endpoints:

Register (username, password): creates a new valid user
Login: returns a token for access API
Enable Authorization on the other endpoints making them available only to registered users
[EXTRA]

Implement refresh token technique
